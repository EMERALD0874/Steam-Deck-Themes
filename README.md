# Steam Deck Themes

This repository contains various themes that I created for use with [suchmememanyskill's Steam Deck CSS loader](https://github.com/suchmememanyskill/SDH-CssLoader). Many of these themes are smaller components that can be built upon, such as a centered home screen. Please feel free to use my work as a part of your own themes. Attribution is always appreciated but not required.

## Theme Packs

Below are previews and brief descriptions for each theme pack. These are large themes that contain a variety of changes to overhaul the entire Steam Deck interface.

### Galactic

This theme is intended to be a rounded, clean, and modern look while still providing eye candy when looking at the recent games. This was my first theme pack and my
first attempt at learning a variety of new CSS changes such as fonts and backgrounds that work on the go.

## Themes

Below are previews and brief descriptions for each theme. These are generally smaller themes that are meant to be combined with other themes or used on their own to
provide minimal changes to the Steam Deck interface.

### Centered Home

This theme makes the recent games section take up the full screen and centers it vertically. Options are provided for hiding and showing the header as well as whether
or not to consider the title of the game when centering vertically (assuming the header is hidden). I recommend using this with the Static Background theme by SuchMeme
pictured below.

### Fonts

This theme adds a variety of fonts and control over capitalization to the Steam Deck. Fonts used in any of my other themes as well as certain unique fonts are available
through this theme. Additional fonts can be contributed through a pull request. Pictured below is Roboto with standard capitalization enforced.

### Obsidian

This theme is based off of pure black themes commonly created for AMOLED devices. Although the Steam Deck has an LCD screen, I find the darker colors easier on my eyes
and less Steam-themed.

### Round

This theme adds round edges to any image that can reasonably have them. Certain images like achievements, trading cards, and profile pictures have been left as-is to
avoid removing any detail. Anything largely rectangular or difficult to round (ex. sets of buttons, chat, header) has also been left as-is.

If you want to contribute to my themes, please create an issue first and only do so to fix missing style changes. Make sure to specify in your pull request what I
missed and include screenshots of how you fixed it. I greatly appreciate any help in refining my themes.
